🩺 ETL Pipeline with Python & Pandas – Health & Lifestyle Dataset

This project demonstrates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and the Pandas library. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and focuses on various health and lifestyle metrics. The notebook walks through data extraction, transformation, cleaning, and exploratory visualization — providing a practical example of how raw data can be processed into meaningful insights.

📊 Project Overview

Goal:
To build a simple yet effective ETL workflow in Python — from reading raw CSV data to transforming it into a usable format and finally visualizing key trends.

What’s Covered:

📥 Extract: Load a public dataset from Kaggle into a Pandas DataFrame

🔧 Transform: Clean, preprocess, and reshape data to prepare it for analysis

📊 Load & Visualize: Generate exploratory visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn
